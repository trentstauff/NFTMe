## NFTMe

### Getting Setup
`git clone https://github.com/trentstauff/NFTMe.git `
`cd NFTMe`
`set FLASK_APP=run.py` (on windows) `export FLASK_APP=run.py` (on unix)
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`flask run`

Then, you'll see a link where the application is running (should look like `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`)
